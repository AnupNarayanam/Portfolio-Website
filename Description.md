## This Read me file is a brief description of the website i made 

At first when i had the idea of making this website i fixed what colours i need to include in my website they are red , white and black . Then later i decided how many html pages should my website be split into i liked it because its decent way of making the website instead of using the bookmarking meathod in html . I have decided to split it into Home page , about page , projects page and contact page . After deciding that i later thought of the basic structure of the webpages i made a navbar and a footer , where navbar contain the my portfolio instead of any logo and the html pages href links where thay are navigated to the respective pages and in the footer part i added the same thing except the my portfolio and instead added the href links for my social media handles these href are linked to the images accordingly when the image is clicked it redirects to the respective social handle in a new page because for every link i have given the target as blank . 

Now coming to the concepts that i have used in making my website I have used href , inserting an image , linking the redirecting link to the image , forms , lists , and various tags that are used in html are used in making of my  website i tried to cover as many topics as possible which are taught by my ma'am , and in the styling part i used flexbox concept and grid type display , animations , keyframes , wanted to use trnsform in css but didnt apply because i achived a decent website which satisfied me , at last i made the website responsive for few devices , it worked in 3 laptops of different sizes and my dads phone but not in my phone the styling alignment was odd when it is displayed in my phone which had dimentions which i didnt specify in the code . Used all the concepts those are explained by my ma'am , thankfully the styling was made easier because of the box model which is taught by her because i always used to inspect the page and knew how much padding or margin space should given every time i go wrong .

I created a container where all the data in the website goes inside and fits in it so that it doesn't strt at the strt of the webpage and then the styling wouldnt be soo difficult so i applied the desired styling to the container directly .

I have added the matrix rain as my background because it is the easy one to style in the animations and the best looking one which looks professional and i have added an animations for the buttons that i have used in my website , when the cus=rsor is hoved above the btn they fade in the color red and they display the box shadow red color etc ....
